# Rela 3 - A June's Celebration themed match 3 game project

This project is a fun Match 3 styled game crafted by our community during lives on IndieGabo's [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/indiegabo_dev). Our goal is to have a beautiful and polished 3D scenario
and provide a happy experience with fun mechanics.

## What we have built so far

- An 8x8 tiled board to accomodate our movable pieces
- As we press start the board is populated by pieces making sure no matchs happen before the player's first move
- Player "moves" are registered. We will use this soon.

## Unity Version

Tested on [2020.3.25f1 LTS](https://unity3d.com/pt/unity/whats-new/2020.3.25)
